  <h2 class="qa-title">Our Story:</h2>

  <div class="qa-item">
    <h2 class="question">1. When was the establishment created and how did the idea come about?</h2>
    <p class="answer">The idea started when my partner and I often found ourselves craving a cozy place to relax somewhere different from the usual spots, where we could enjoy a good cup of coffee and just unwind. That craving sparked the concept of creating our own space that offers that kind of vibe. Eventually, we turned that idea into reality.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-item">

    <h2 class="question">2. How many people are working with you?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Currently, we're a team of four dedicated members. Each of us plays a vital role in keeping everything running smoothly, from preparing the drinks to ensuring our customers always feel welcome and satisfied.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-item">
    <h2 class="question">3. Why did you choose a truck for your establishment?</h2>
    <p class="answer">We chose to go with a coffee truck because it's something unique, cost-efficient, and flexible. Unlike a traditional café, it allows us to be mobile and bring our coffee experience to different places. It also helped us start with lower overhead costs while still offering a standout experience.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-item">
    <h2 class="question">4. How is your establishment doing so far? Would you consider it successful?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Absolutely. In just five months, we've seen incredible support from the community. We've received a lot of positive feedback and have already built a solid base of loyal customers. It's been a rewarding journey so far, and we're proud of what we've achieved.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-item">
    <h2 class="question">5. What do you think about the future of your establishment?</h2>
    <p class="answer">We're very excited about the future. One of our main goals is to eventually open a standalone café with a nature-inspired design — a more permanent space where people can relax, stay longer, and enjoy a wider variety of snacks and meals. At the same time, we plan to keep our original coffee truck in its current location to continue serving our regular customers.</p>
